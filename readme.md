Welcome to covid virus attack game. A player appears in city that is under 
attack by deadly viruses. The player avoids viruses coming from above by moving left, right, up or down, and tries to reach for 
antidote/vaccine to boost its immunity level. The immunity level is displayed on 
the game screen, and is equivalent to the player's life. If immunity level is 
down to zero, and it get hit by a virus, player dies and game ends.
